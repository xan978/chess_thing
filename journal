5/12/25 - 5/15/25  created and finished is_stalemate method. this detectes if a stalemate happens
5/5/25  - 5/8/25   finished checkmate code. the is_checkmate method will check if the king can move out of the way,
                   if it cant, then it will check if any of their pieces can block the checkmate, if not, then its checkmate
4/28/25 - 4/30/25  created code that checks for checkmate
4/16/25 - 4/17/25  now you must move out of check or move a piece to block the check. also combined
                   move_piece and one other method together for simplicity
4/15/25  created castle method in board class, and completed all of the code for castling

4/7/25 - 4/10/25  created display class and learned more about pygame
3/31/25 - 4/2/25  king piece now cant move into check, added new function in logic class that can detect if a square
                  is being attacked

3/10/25 - 3/14/25  added logic so that you can't move the other player's piece. add more to move_piece function so
                   that it checks if its a legal move by using the piece class
3/3/25 - 3/7/25  made it so that the game displays the chess board differently depending if you are currently playing
                 as white or black, added a check so that you cant move a empty square onto another piece.
2/24/25 - 2/28/25  made logic file, added ability to add and remove pieces, made a interactive menu to interact with the
                   chess board, added different pieces that can go on the board.
